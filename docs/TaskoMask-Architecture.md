## 1. Introduction

TaskoMask is a sophisticated task management system built using modern microservices architecture. The solution implements industry best practices including CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation), Event Sourcing, and Domain-Driven Design.

### 1.1 Purpose
The system provides a scalable and maintainable platform for:
- Task and project management
- Team collaboration
- Process tracking
- Resource organization

### 1.2 Key Features
- Microservices-based architecture
- Event-driven design
- Scalable data management
- Secure authentication and authorization
- Real-time updates

## 2. System Overview

### 2.1 Core Services
1. **Boards Service**
   - Manages project boards and cards
   - Implements CQRS pattern
   - Handles board-related operations

2. **Tasks Service**
   - Task management and tracking
   - Comment handling
   - Status updates

3. **Identity Service**
   - User authentication and authorization
   - Role-based access control
   - OAuth2/OpenID Connect implementation

4. **Owners Service**
   - Permission management
   - Resource ownership
   - Access control

### 2.2 Supporting Infrastructure
- API Gateway
- Message Queue (RabbitMQ)
- Event Store (Redis)
- Document Database (MongoDB)

## 3. Architecture

### 3.1 Architectural Patterns

#### CQRS Implementation
The solution implements CQRS through:
- Separate Read and Write APIs
- Dedicated read and write databases
- Event-driven synchronization

```plaintext
Command Flow:
Client → API Gateway → Write API → Event Store → Read Model Update

Query Flow:
Client → API Gateway → Read API → Optimized Read Store
```

#### Event Sourcing
- Events as source of truth
- Redis-based event store
- Event replay capability
- Audit trail support

#### Microservices Communication
- Event-driven using MassTransit/RabbitMQ
- gRPC for synchronous operations
- REST APIs for client communication

### 3.2 Building Blocks

The solution's foundation is built on shared components:

1. **Domain Layer**
   - Core business logic
   - Entity definitions
   - Value objects
   - Domain events

2. **Application Layer**
   - Use case implementations
   - Command/Query handlers
   - Application services

3. **Infrastructure Layer**
   - Technical implementations
   - External service integrations
   - Data persistence

4. **Contracts**
   - DTOs
   - Event definitions
   - API contracts

## 4. Core Components

### 4.1 Event Store Implementation
```csharp
public class RedisEventStoreService : IEventStoreService
{
    private readonly IConnectionMultiplexer _redisConnection;
    private readonly IDatabase _redisDb;

    public async Task SaveAsync<TDomainEvent>(TDomainEvent @event)
        where TDomainEvent : DomainEvent
    {
        var storedEvent = GetEventDataToStore(@event);
        await _redisDb.ListLeftPushAsync(MakeKey(@event.EntityId), jsonData);
    }
}
```

### 4.2 Message Queue Integration
```csharp
public class MassTransitEventPublisher : IEventPublisher
{
    private readonly IPublishEndpoint _publishEndpoint;

    public async Task Publish<TEvent>(TEvent @event)
        where TEvent : IIntegrationEvent
    {
        await _publishEndpoint.Publish(@event);
    }
}
```

### 4.3 API Gateway
- Route aggregation
- Authentication middleware
- Request transformation
- Load balancing

## 5. Technical Implementation

### 5.1 Service Implementation

Each service follows Clean Architecture:
```plaintext
ServiceName/
├── Domain/          # Business logic
├── Application/     # Use cases
├── Infrastructure/  # Technical details
└── API/            # Controllers
```

### 5.2 Data Management
- Event sourcing for write operations
- MongoDB for read models
- Redis for caching
- Event store for audit trails

### 5.3 Security
- JWT-based authentication
- OAuth2 authorization
- Role-based access control
- Scope-based permissions

## 6. Deployment

### 6.1 Container Support
- Docker containers for each service
- Docker Compose for development
- Kubernetes-ready configuration

### 6.2 Configuration Management
- Environment-specific settings
- Secret management
- Feature toggles

## 7. Best Practices

### 7.1 Development Guidelines
- Clean Architecture principles
- Domain-Driven Design
- SOLID principles
- Event-driven design

### 7.2 Testing Strategy
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Event sourcing tests
- API tests

### 7.3 Monitoring and Logging
- OpenTelemetry integration
- Centralized logging
- Metrics collection
- Distributed tracing

## Conclusion

TaskoMask demonstrates a modern approach to building scalable, maintainable microservices. Its implementation of CQRS, event sourcing, and clean architecture provides a robust foundation for complex business applications.
